\description{
This dataset is a synthesis of randomized controlled studies investigating the effects
of different agents for preventing vomiting within 24 h postoperatively
in adults after general anaesthesia.
Multicomponent interventions have been excluded from this subset to focus on
single-agent interventions and their dose-response relationships.
}
\details{
The dataset includes data on several agents for preventing vomiting and their observed effects
across multiple clinical randomized controlled trials. The outcome is the occurrence of vomiting
within 24 hours after surgery. By excluding multicomponent interventions, this subset
allows for a more precise evaluation of single-agent dose-response relationships.

The dataset is structured in a contrast-based format and includes the following variables:
\itemize{
  \item \code{agent1}, \code{agent2}, \code{agent3}, \code{agent4}, \code{agent5}: Names of the anesthetic agents used in each study arm.
  \item \code{event1}, \code{event2}, \code{event3}, \code{event4}, \code{event5}: Number of participants who experienced vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively in each study arm.
  \item \code{n1}, \code{n2}, \code{n3}, \code{n4}, \code{n5}: Total number of participants in each study arm.
  \item \code{dose1}, \code{dose2}, \code{dose3}, \code{dose4}, \code{dose5}: Dose levels of the anesthetic agents in each study arm.
  \item \code{studyid}: Unique identifier for the study.
}

This dataset is intended for use in dose-response network meta-analysis to explore
the effects of single agents across various doses.
