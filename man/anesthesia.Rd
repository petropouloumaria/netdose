\title{Anesthesia Dataset for Dose-Response Network Meta-Analysis}
\format{
A data frame with the following columns:
\tabular{rl}{
  \bold{\emph{agent}} \tab Character vector indicating the name of the anesthetic agent. \cr
  \bold{\emph{event}} \tab Integer vector for the number of participants who experienced vomiting. \cr
  \bold{\emph{n}} \tab Integer vector for the total number of participants in the study arm. \cr
  \bold{\emph{dose}} \tab Numeric vector specifying the dose levels of the anesthetic agents. \cr
  \bold{\emph{studlab}} \tab Character vector with unique study identifiers.

The dataset is a subset of data derived from:

\description{
This dataset is a subset of a synthesis of randomized controlled studies investigating the effects
of different anesthetic agents on vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively.
Multicomponent interventions have been excluded from this subset to focus on
single-agent interventions and their dose-response relationships.
}
\details{
The dataset includes data on several anesthetic agents and their observed effects
across multiple clinical randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome is the occurrence of vomiting
within 24 hours after surgery. By excluding multicomponent interventions, this subset
allows for a more precise evaluation of single-agent dose-response relationships.

The dataset is structured in an arm-level format and includes the following variables:
\itemize{
  \item \code{agent}: Name of the anesthetic agent.
  \item \code{event}: Number of participants who experienced vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively.
  \item \code{n}: Total number of participants in the study arm.
  \item \code{dose}: Dose levels of the anesthetic agents.
  \item \code{studlab}: Unique identifier for the study.
}

This dataset is intended for use in dose-response network meta-analysis to explore
the effects of single agents across various doses.
