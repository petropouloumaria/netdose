The dataset is a subset of data derived from:

with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis. The Lancet. 2018;391:1357â€“1366.

\description{
This dataset is a synthesis of randomized controlled studies investigating the effects of antidepressant
interventions for unipolar major depressive disorder.
}
\details{
The dataset includes data on several antidepressant agents and their observed effects
across multiple clinical randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome is the response rate,
defined as the proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in symptoms.

The dataset is structured in an arm-level format and includes the following variables:
\itemize{
  \item \code{drug}: Name of the antidepressant agent.
  \item \code{r}: Number of participants who responded to treatment.
  \item \code{n}: Total number of participants in the study arm.
  \item \code{dose}: Dose level of the antidepressant agent.
  \item \code{studyid}: Unique study identifier.
}

This dataset is intended for use in dose-response network meta-analysis to explore
the effects of the several agents across various doses.
